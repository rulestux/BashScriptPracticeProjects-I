# BashScriptPracticeProjects-I

This repository documents challenge solutions where I pratice solving problems with Shell Script.

## Description

## Repository Structure

- __Exercises__: Each folder contains the solution for a specific challenge, clearly documented.
- __Documentation__: Includes comments in the scripts to clarify the logic used.
